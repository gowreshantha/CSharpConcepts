          Implict conversion is done by the compiler:
          - When there  is no loss of information if the conversion is done
          - If there is no possibility of throwing exceptions during the conversion

          Ex: Converting an int to a float will not loose any date and no exception will be thrown, 
          hence an implicit conversion can be done.

          When converting a float to an int, we loose the frational part and also a possibility of overflow exception. hence, 
          in this case an explicit conversion is required.
          For explict conversion we can use cast operator or the convert class in c#

          Diff b/w Parse and TryParse
          If the number is in a string format you have 2 options
          -Parse() and TryParse()

          Parse() method throws an exception if it cannot parse the value,
          whereas TryParse() returns a bool indicating whether it succeeded or failed.

          Use Parse() if you are sure the value will be valid, otherwise use tryParse()
