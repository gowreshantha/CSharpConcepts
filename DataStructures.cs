        Data Structure - A data structure is the systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
        Example
        Arrays - Data structure used to store images as a bitmap
        Stack data structure is used in implementing redo and undo feature ex docs
        Graph, List, Queue, Tree, Dictionary

        Data Types vs Abstract Data Types
        DT > defines a certain domain of values & operations allowed on those values
        ex int type (takes only integer values, operations + - / bitwise %
        primitive data types and user defined data types 
        ADT > ADTs are like user defined data types which defines operations on values using functions
        without specifying what is there inside the funcation and how the operations are performed.
        Ex Stach ADT - consists of elements of same type arranged in a seq order, Push() Pop() 
        which hides the inner structre and design of the data type from the user

        Types of Data Structures

        Linear Data Structures > A data structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear(sequential) order.
        ex: Array, Queue, Stack & Linked List
        Note: Liner data strucures will have one predecessror (before) and one successor(after) but exception for first and last element is wont have predecessror or successro
        Non Linear Data Structures > A data structure is non linear when all the elements are not arranged in a linear (seq) order. 
        ex: Tree, Graph


        Static Data Structures
        In these type of ds, the memory is allocated at compile time, Therefore max size is fixed.
        Advantage: Fast access
        Disadvantage: Slower insertion and deletion
        ex- Arrays
        Dynamic Data Structures
        In these type of ds, the memory is allocated at run time, Therefore max size is flexible.
        Advantage: Faster insertion and deletion
        Disadvantage: Slower access
        ex- Linked List
